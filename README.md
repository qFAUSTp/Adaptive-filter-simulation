# Adaptive filter simulation
 Simulation of adaptive filter in simulink & matlab.
 
 This project was tested on Matlab 2015.
 
 To run it, simple call AF_run(SimTime) function with setting how much time simulation you need. SimTime is just amount of {0;1} in pseudo-random sequences (look in GMSK.slx).
